\title{Scatterplot matrix with information about missing/imputed values}
\description{
    Scatterplot matrix in which observations with missing/imputed values in certain 
    variables are highlighted.
}
\usage{
TKRscattmatrixMiss(x, delimiter = NULL, highlight = NULL, 
  selection = c("any","all"), 
  plotvars = NULL, col = c("skyblue", "red", "orange"), 
  alpha = NULL, hscale = NULL, 
  vscale = NULL, TKRpar = list(), ...)
}
\arguments{
    \item{x}{a matrix or \code{data.frame}.}
    \item{delimiter}{a character-vector to distinguish between variables
    	and imputation-indices for imputed variables (therefore, \code{x} needs
    	to have \code{\link{colnames}}). If given, it is used to determine the corresponding
    	imputation-index for any imputed variable (a logical-vector indicating
    	which values of the variable have been imputed). If such imputation-indices
    	are found, they are used for highlighting and the colors are adjusted 
    	according to the given colors for imputed variables (see \code{col}).}
    \item{highlight}{a vector giving the variables to be used for 
        highlighting.  If \code{NULL} (the default), all variables 
        are used for highlighting.}
    \item{selection}{the selection method for highlighting missing/imputed values in 
        multiple highlight variables.  Possible values are \code{"any"} 
        (highlighting of missing/imputed values in \emph{any} of the highlight 
        variables) and \code{"all"} (highlighting of missing/imputed values in 
        \emph{all} of the highlight variables).}
    \item{plotvars}{a vector giving the variables to be plotted.  If 
        \code{NULL} (the default), all variables are plotted.}
    \item{col}{a vector of length three giving the colors to be used in the plot.  
        The second/third color will be used for highlighting missing/imputed values.}
    \item{alpha}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the level of 
        transparency of the colors, or \code{NULL}.  This can be used to
        prevent overplotting.}
    \item{\dots}{for \code{scattmatrixMiss}, further arguments and 
        graphical parameters to be passed to \code{\link{pairsVIM}}.  
        \code{par("oma")} will be set appropriately unless supplied (see 
        \code{\link[graphics]{par}}).  For \code{TKRscattmatrixMiss}, further 
        arguments to be passed to \code{scattmatrixMiss}.}
    \item{hscale}{horizontal scale factor for plot to be embedded in a 
        \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details}).  The default value 
        depends on the number of variables.}
    \item{vscale}{vertical scale factor for the plot to be embedded in a 
        \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details}).  The default value 
        depends on the number of variables.}
    \item{TKRpar}{a list of graphical parameters to be set for the plot 
        to be embedded in a \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details} and 
        \code{\link[graphics]{par}}).}
}
\details{
    \code{scattmatrixMiss} uses \code{\link{pairsVIM}} with a panel function 
    that allows highlighting of missing/imputed values.
    
    If \code{interactive=TRUE}, the variables to be used for highlighting 
    can be selected interactively.  Observations with missing/imputed values in any 
    or in all of the selected variables are highlighted (as determined by 
    \code{selection}).  A variable can be added to the selection by clicking 
    in a diagonal panel.  If a variable is already selected, clicking on the 
    corresponding diagonal panel removes it from the selection.  Clicking 
    anywhere else quits the interactive session.
        
    The graphical parameter \code{oma} will be set unless supplied as an 
    argument.
    
    \code{TKRscattmatrixMiss} behaves like \code{scattmatrixMiss}, but uses 
    \code{\link[tkrplot]{tkrplot}} to embed the plot in a \emph{Tcl/Tk} 
    window.  This is useful if the number of variables is large, because 
    scrollbars allow to move from one part of the plot to another.
}
\note{
    Some of the argument names and positions have changed with version 1.3 
    due to a re-implementation and for more consistency with other plot 
    functions in \code{VIM}.  For back compatibility, the argument 
    \code{colcomb} can still be supplied to \code{\dots} and is handled 
    correctly.  Nevertheless, it is deprecated and no longer documented.  
    Use \code{highlight} instead.  The arguments \code{smooth}, 
    \code{reg.line} and \code{legend.plot} are no longer used and 
    ignored if supplied.
