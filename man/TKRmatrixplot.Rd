\title{Matrix plot}
\description{
  Create a matrix plot, in which all cells of a data matrix are visualized by 
  rectangles.  Available data is coded according to a continuous color scheme, 
  while missing/imputed data is visualized by a clearly distinguishable color.
}
\usage{

TKRmatrixplot(x, delimiter = NULL, hscale = NULL, 
  vscale = NULL, TKRpar = list(), ...)

}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a matrix or \code{data.frame}.}
  \item{delimiter}{a character-vector to distinguish between variables
    	and imputation-indices for imputed variables (therefore, \code{x} needs
    	to have \code{\link{colnames}}). If given, it is used to determine the
    	corresponding imputation-index for any imputed variable (a logical-vector
    	indicating which values of the variable have been imputed). If such
    	imputation-indices are found, they are used for highlighting and the
    	colors are adjusted	according to the given colors for imputed variables
    	(see \code{col}).}
  \item{\dots}{for \code{matrixplot} and \code{iimagMiss}, further graphical 
    parameters to be passed to \code{\link[graphics]{plot.window}}, 
    \code{\link[graphics]{title}} and \code{\link[graphics]{axis}}.  For 
    \code{TKRmatrixplot}, further arguments to be passed to \code{matrixplot}.}
  \item{hscale}{horizontal scale factor for plot to be embedded in a 
    \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details}).  The default value depends on 
    the number of variables.}
  \item{vscale}{vertical scale factor for the plot to be embedded in a 
    \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details}).  The default value depends on 
    the number of observations.}
  \item{TKRpar}{a list of graphical parameters to be set for the plot to be 
    embedded in a \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details} and 
    \code{\link[graphics]{par}}).}
}
\details{
  In a \emph{matrix plot}, all cells of a data matrix are visualized by 
  rectangles.  Available data is coded according to a continuous color scheme.  
  To compute the colors via interpolation, the variables are first scaled to 
  the interval \eqn{$[0,1]$}{[0,1]}. Missing/imputed values can then be visualized by a 
  clearly distinguishable color. It is thereby possible to use colors in the
  \emph{HCL} or \emph{RGB} color space. A simple way of visualizing the 
  magnitude of the available data is to apply a greyscale, which has the 
  advantage that missing/imputed values can easily be distinguished by using a color 
  such as red/orange.  Note that \code{-Inf} and \code{Inf} are always assigned the 
  begin and end color, respectively, of the continuous color scheme.
  
  Additionally, the observations can be sorted by the magnitude of a selected 
  variable.  If \code{interactive} is \code{TRUE}, clicking in a column redraws 
  the plot with observations sorted by the corresponding variable.  Clicking 
  anywhere outside the plot region quits the interactive session.
  
  \code{TKRmatrixplot} behaves like \code{matrixplot}, but uses 
  \code{\link[tkrplot]{tkrplot}} to embed the plot in a \emph{Tcl/Tk} window.  
  This is useful if the number of observations and/or variables is large, 
  because scrollbars allow to move from one part of the plot to another.
}
\note{
  This is a much more powerful extension to the function  
  \code{imagmiss} in the former CRAN package \code{dprep}.
  
  \code{iimagMiss} is deprecated and may be omitted in future versions of 
  \code{VIM}.  Use \code{matrixplot} instead.
