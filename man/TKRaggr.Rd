\title{Aggregations for missing/imputed values}
\description{
  Calculate or plot the amount of missing/imputed values
  in each variable and the amount of missing/imputed values
  in certain combinations of variables.
}
\usage{
TKRaggr(x, \dots, delimiter = NULL, hscale = NULL, vscale = NULL,
    TKRpar = list())
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a vector, matrix or \code{data.frame}.}
  \item{delimiter}{a character-vector to distinguish between variables
    	and imputation-indices for imputed variables (therefore, \code{x} needs
    	to have \code{\link{colnames}}). If given, it is used to determine the corresponding
    	imputation-index for any imputed variable (a logical-vector indicating
    	which values of the variable have been imputed). If such imputation-indices
    	are found, they are used for highlighting and the colors are adjusted 
    	according to the given colors for imputed variables (see \code{col}).}
  \item{\dots}{for \code{aggr} and \code{TKRaggr}, further arguments and 
    graphical parameters to be passed to \code{\link{plot.aggr}}.  For 
    \code{plot.aggr}, further graphical parameters to be passed down.  
    \code{par("oma")} will be set appropriately unless supplied (see 
    \code{\link[graphics]{par}}).}
  \item{hscale}{horizontal scale factor for plot to be embedded in a 
    \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details}).  The default value 
    depends on the number of variables.}
  \item{vscale}{vertical scale factor for the plot to be embedded in a 
    \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details}).  The default value 
    depends on the number of combinations.}
  \item{TKRpar}{a list of graphical parameters to be set for the plot 
    to be embedded in a \emph{Tcl/Tk} window (see \sQuote{Details} and 
    \code{\link[graphics]{par}}).}
}
\details{
  Often it is of interest how many missing/imputed values are contained in each 
  variable.  Even more interesting, there may be certain combinations of 
  variables with a high number of missing/imputed values.
  
  If \code{combined} is \code{FALSE}, two separate plots are drawn for the 
  missing/imputed values in each variable and the combinations of missing/imputed and 
  non-missing values. The barplot on the left hand side shows the amount of 
  missing/imputed values in each variable.  In the \emph{aggregation plot} on the right 
  hand side, all existing combinations of missing/imputed and non-missing values in 
  the observations are visualized.  Available, missing and imputed data are color
  coded as given by \code{col}.  Additionally, there are two possibilities to 
  represent the frequencies of occurrence of the different combinations.  The 
  first option is to visualize the proportions or frequencies by a small bar 
  plot and/or numbers.  The second option is to let the cell heights be given 
  by the frequencies of the corresponding combinations. Furthermore, variables 
  may be sorted by the number of missing/imputed values and combinations by the 
  frequency of occurrence to give more power to finding the structure of 
  missing/imputed values.
  
  If \code{combined} is \code{TRUE}, a small version of the barplot showing 
  the amount of missing/imputed values in each variable is drawn on top of the 
  aggregation plot.
  
  The graphical parameter \code{oma} will be set unless supplied as an 
  argument.
  
  \code{TKRaggr} behaves like \code{plot.aggr}, but uses 
  \code{\link[tkrplot]{tkrplot}} to embed the plot in a \emph{Tcl/Tk} 
  window.  This is useful if the number of variables and/or combinations 
  is large, because scrollbars allow to move from one part of the plot 
  to another.
}
\value{
  for \code{aggr}, a list of class \code{"aggr"} containing the following 
  components:
  \item{x}{the data used.}
  \item{combinations}{a character vector representing the combinations of 
    variables.}
  \item{count}{the frequencies of these combinations.}
  \item{percent}{the percentage of these combinations.}
  \item{missings}{a \code{data.frame} containing the amount of missing/imputed values 
    in each variable.}
  \item{tabcomb}{the indicator matrix for the combinations of variables.}
}
\note{
    Some of the argument names and positions have changed with version 1.3 
    due to extended functionality and for more consistency with other plot 
    functions in \code{VIM}.  For back compatibility, the arguments 
    \code{labs} and \code{names.arg} can still be supplied to \code{\dots} 
    and are handled correctly.  Nevertheless, they are deprecated and no 
    longer documented.  Use \code{ylabs} and \code{labels} instead.
