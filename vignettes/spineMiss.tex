\begin{Description}\relax
Spineplot or spinogram with highlighting of missing/imputed values in 
other variables by splitting each cell into two parts.  Additionally, 
information about missing/imputed values in the variable of interest is shown 
on the right hand side.
\end{Description}

\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
spineMiss(x, delimiter = NULL, pos = 1, selection = c("any", "all"),
    breaks = "Sturges", right = TRUE, col = c("skyblue","red",
    "skyblue4","red4","orange","orange4"), border = NULL, main = NULL,
    sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, axes = TRUE, labels = axes,
    only.miss = TRUE, miss.labels = axes, interactive = TRUE, ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{x}] a vector, matrix or \code{data.frame}.
\item[\code{delimiter}] a character-vector to distinguish between variables
and imputation-indices for imputed variables (therefore, \code{x} needs
to have \code{\LinkA{colnames}{colnames}}). If given, it is used to determine the corresponding
imputation-index for any imputed variable (a logical-vector indicating
which values of the variable have been imputed). If such imputation-indices
are found, they are used for highlighting and the colors are adjusted 
according to the given colors for imputed variables (see \code{col}).
\item[\code{pos}] a numeric value giving the index of the variable of 
interest.  Additional variables in \code{x} are used for 
highlighting.
\item[\code{selection}] the selection method for highlighting missing/imputed values 
in multiple additional variables.  Possible values are \code{"any"} 
(highlighting of missing/imputed values in \emph{any} of the additional 
variables) and \code{"all"} (highlighting of missing/imputed values in 
\emph{all} of the additional variables).
\item[\code{breaks}] if the variable of interest is numeric, \code{breaks} 
controls the breakpoints (see \code{\LinkA{hist}{hist}} for 
possible values).
\item[\code{right}] logical; if \code{TRUE} and the variable of interest is 
numeric, the spinogram cells are right-closed (left-open) intervals.
\item[\code{col}] a vector of length six giving the colors to be used. If 
only one color is supplied, the bars are transparent and the 
supplied color is used for highlighting missing/imputed values.
Else if two colors are supplied, they are recycled.
\item[\code{border}] the color to be used for the border of the cells. 
Use \code{border=NA} to omit borders.
\item[\code{main, sub}] main and sub title.
\item[\code{xlab, ylab}] axis labels.
\item[\code{axes}] a logical indicating whether axes should be drawn 
on the plot.
\item[\code{labels}] if the variable of interest is categorical, either a 
logical indicating whether labels should be plotted below each cell, 
or a character vector giving the labels.  This is ignored if the 
variable of interest is numeric.
\item[\code{only.miss}] logical; if \code{TRUE}, the missing/imputed values in the 
variable of interest are also visualized by a cell in the spineplot or 
spinogram.  Otherwise, a small spineplot is drawn on the right hand 
side (see `Details').
\item[\code{miss.labels}] either a logical indicating whether label(s) should 
be plotted below the cell(s) on the right hand side, or a character 
string or vector giving the label(s) (see `Details').
\item[\code{interactive}] a logical indicating whether the variables can be 
switched interactively (see `Details').
\item[\code{...}] further graphical parameters to be passed to 
\code{\LinkA{title}{title}} and \code{\LinkA{axis}{axis}}.
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}

\begin{Details}\relax
A spineplot is created if the variable of interest is categorial 
and a spinogram if it is numerical.  The horizontal axis is scaled 
according to relative frequencies of the categories/classes.  If 
more than one variable is supplied, the cells are split according to 
missingness/number of imputed values in the additional variables. 
Thus the proportion of highlighted observations in each category/class
is displayed on the vertical axis. Since the height of each cell 
corresponds to the proportion of highlighted observations, it is now
possible to compare the proportions of missing/imputed values among the 
different categories/classes.

If \code{only.miss=TRUE}, the missing/imputed values in the variable of interest 
are also visualized by a cell in the spine plot or spinogram.  If 
additional variables are supplied, this cell is again split into two 
parts according to missingness/number if imputed values in the additional
variables.

Otherwise, a small spineplot that visualizes missing/imputed values in the 
variable of interest is drawn on the right hand side.  The first cell 
corresponds to observed values and the second cell to missing/imputed values.  
Each of the two cells is again split into two parts according to 
missingness/number of imputed values in the additional variables.
Note that this display does  not make sense if only one variable is supplied,
therefore \code{only.miss} is ignored in that case.

If \code{interactive=TRUE}, clicking in the left margin of the plot 
results in switching to the previous variable and clicking in the right 
margin results in switching to the next variable.  Clicking anywhere 
else on the graphics device quits the interactive session.

\begin{Value}
a table containing the frequencies corresponding to the cells.
\end{Value}

\begin{Note}\relax
Some of the argument names and positions have changed with version 1.3 
due to extended functionality and for more consistency with other plot 
functions in \code{VIM}.  For back compatibility, the arguments 
\code{xaxlabels} and \code{missaxlabels} can still be supplied to 
\code{...} and are handled correctly.  Nevertheless, they 
are deprecated and no longer documented.  Use \code{labels} and 
\code{miss.labels} instead.

The code is based on the function \code{\LinkA{spineplot}{spineplot}} by 
Achim Zeileis.
